# STEP-UP-CONVERTER-DC---DC-
The boost converter is used to "step-up" an input voltage to some higher level, required by a load.

# OBJECTIVE

The main purpose of this project is to introduce a design and development method of a dc-dc boost converter with constant output voltage. From a fluctuating or a variable input voltage, boost converter is able to step up the input voltage to a higher constant dc output voltage using voltage feedback technique. By this technique, the output of the converter is measured and compared with a reference voltage. The differential of the compared value will be used to produce a pulse width modulation signal to control switch in the boost converter. Simulation results describe the performance of the proposed design.
